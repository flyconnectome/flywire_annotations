## Explanation of columns for `Supplemental_file1_annotations.tsv`
- `pos_x`, `pos_y`, `pos_z` are anchor coordinates in 4x4x40nm voxel space (typically on the backbone of the neuron) for given neuron
- `supervoxel_id` is the ID of the supervoxel the anchor coordinates map to
- `root_id` is the ID of the neuron in the FlyWire `630` release 
- `soma_x`, `soma_y`, `soma_z` are soma coordinates in 4x4x40nm voxel space
- `nucleus_id` maps to the nucleus detection table (available through CAVE); neurons with `soma_x/y/z` but without `nucleus_id` have had their soma manually marked
- `flow`, `super_class`, `cell_class`, `cell_sub_class`, `cell_type`, `hemibrain_type` are the hierarchical annotations
- `ito_lee_hemilineage` and `hartenstein_hemilineage` provide the hemilineage in ItoLee and Hartenstein nomenclature; note that not all labels exist in the Hartenstein nomenclature
- `morphology_group` provides a coarse morphological grouping based on hemilineage clustering
- `top_nt` is the top predicted neurotransmitter for the given neuron, calculated by averaging confidences over the transmitter predictions for all presynapses for the given neuron and choosing the most confident transmitter
- `top_nt_conf` is the average confidence for the top neurotransmitter
- `side` refers to the soma side for brain-intrinsic neurons and the nerve-entry side for sensory/ascending neurons
- `vfb_id` provides a mapping to the ontology database of the [VirtualFlyBrain](https://virtualflybrain.org/)
